## Analyzing Determinants of Academic Performance

### Overview
This project delves into understanding the key factors influencing student success in Portuguese educational settings. Through exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling, we identified significant determinants of academic performance. The insights gained from this analysis can help educators, policymakers, and students make informed decisions to enhance educational outcomes.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:
- R and RStudio
- R packages: `tidyverse` and `ggplot2`

To install these packages, run the following commands in R:
```R
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2"))
```

### Installation
Clone the project repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KerenOmari-Baah/academic-performance.git
cd academic-performance
```

### Data
This analysis uses data from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) of students' academic performances in two Portuguese schools. The dataset includes attributes like student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features.


### Analysis
The project consists of several analytical phases including:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and summarizing data to uncover patterns and relationships.
3. Predictive Modeling: Applying statistical and machine learning techniques to predict academic performance.
4. Results Interpretation: Discussing the findings and their implications for stakeholders.


### Usage
To reproduce the analysis:
1. Open RStudio and set the project directory as the working directory.
2. Load and execute the provided quarto markdown files.
 

### Acknowledgments
- Thanks to the UCI Machine Learning Repository for providing the dataset.
